## üóÇÔ∏è Projects

### üî∑ OpenGL Projects

| Project             | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CUBE-CREATION**   | Basic 3D cube rendering using OpenGL. Demonstrates object modeling and transformation. |
| **PYRAMID-CREATION**| Creation of a 3D pyramid using OpenGL primitives.                           |
| **PYRAMID-PULSATION**| Animation of a pulsing pyramid to demonstrate scaling transformations.      |
| **BOUNCING-BALL**   | Simulates a bouncing ball to demonstrate basic animation and surface collision. |
| **GRAVITY-BALL**    | Simulates gravity effects on a falling ball with acceleration and bounce response. |

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- OpenGL (C++ or Python bindings)  
- Blender  
- GLUT/GLFW for window management (if applicable)  
- Basic Physics Simulation (for animation projects)

## üìö Purpose

These projects helped reinforce key concepts in computer graphics, such as:

- 3D object modeling and rendering  
- Scene composition  
- Camera and lighting  
- Transformations (scaling, translation, rotation)  
- Animation and physics simulation  
- Blender modeling and animation pipeline
